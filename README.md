# Acceleration-Gear-test
In this command, we will use a program that asks the user to enter a speed of up to 100.0 km/h. on the base Based on the entered speed, the program should calculate and return the acceleration the robot is in according to the following table:

Speed (S) V=Gear

0 < S < 10,0 1 



10,0 <= S < 30,0 2



30,0 <= S < 60,0 3


60,0 <= S < 80,0 4


S >= 80,0 5
S == 0 Neutral
S < 0 R (reverse)

The program should prompt the user to input 10 times, and after 10 times the average input speed should be calculated and printed.
